We are a team of 5 college students with a keen interest in game development. Our first and current game "Belonging" is a project we started for our Video Game Design course, which we intend on continuing in the future. This project is inspired by popular games such as League of Legends and Hollow Knight. 

Future updates will be posted to this site, so stay tuned!
